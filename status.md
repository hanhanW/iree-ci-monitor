## Longest observed queued jobs (last 3d)

_No queued jobs observed._

## Workflow/job waiting time

Aggregated by workflow file/name, job name, and exact `runs-on` label set. This exposes cases where one CI job is constrained more tightly than the broader label pool.

## Per-runner metrics (self-hosted, last 7d)

Only runners that served at least one label with ≤ 15 distinct runners in the lookback window are listed. Ephemeral auto-scaler workers (ubuntu-*, azure-*, macos-*, mi325, etc.) are summarized by label above.

## Methodology

- Window: last 10 hours of job records for queue-time percentiles and failure metrics; queued observations are scanned for 3 days; last 7 days for runner metrics and SPOF.
- Timestamps rendered in `America/Los_Angeles` local time; underlying records are UTC.
- Queue time: `started_at - created_at`. Skipped jobs excluded.
- Queued: jobs with `status == queued` or `waiting` (not yet assigned a runner).
- Running: jobs with `status == in_progress` (runner assigned, executing).
- Oldest queued: `collected_at - created_at` for the oldest job observed with `status == queued` or `waiting`. This is only updated by collection; rerunning the reporter does not inflate stale queued snapshots.
- Workflow/job waiting time: same queue-time definition, grouped by stable workflow id/name + job name + exact label set. Older records collected before `workflow_path` was stored fall back to `workflow_name`.
- All-jobs fail rate: over every completed job (PR + push + schedule).
- Main-only fail rate: subset where `head_branch == main` and `event != pull_request` — post-merge, scheduled, and workflow_dispatch runs. PR noise excluded.
- Runner type:
  - `self-hosted`: persistent physical hosts managed by the IREE infra team (shark fleet, `iree-mi308-1`, etc.). The `runners` count is the number of physical boxes.
  - `github-hosted`: GitHub's standard runner pool (`ubuntu-*`, `macos-*`, `windows-*`) and Actions Hosting partners (`ah-*`). Ephemeral — one worker per job.
  - `ossci`: org-managed autoscaler pools (`azure-*`, `*-ossci-iree-org`). Ephemeral — one worker per job, so the `runners` count here is really "pod spawns in the window" not physical capacity.
- SPOF: label has seen only one distinct `runner_name` in the last 7 days.
- Persistent runner: ran ≥ 5 jobs in the lookback window AND served at least one label with ≤ 15 distinct runners. Ephemeral auto-scaler worker names (which appear once per spawn) are excluded.
- Re-runs: `(job_id, run_attempt)` tuples are distinct; a re-run counts as a new job.

## Alert thresholds

- `queue-starved`: p95 queue > 1h00m
- `stale-queued`: oldest observed queued job (not yet started) > 2h00m
- `high-failure-main`: main-only failure rate > 20% with ≥ 10 completed main-only jobs
- `spof`: only one distinct runner in last 7d
